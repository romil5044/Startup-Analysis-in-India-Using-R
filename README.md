# Startup-Analysis-in-India-Using-R

Overview : Startups have always intrigued me, thus this project was to analyze the startups in India and create a cheat sheet
for a successful startup idea. 

Performed data cleaning by removing null values & redundant values, restructuring columns, converting data types and
deleting duplicated rows & columns

Analyzed the correlation between several variables and developed linear regression models to create a list of important
parameters to cover in the dashboard

Designed a "Startup in India" dashboard using R, considering important parameters such as location, amount of investment, 
startup type, startup industry, investor names to give new startup ideas a direction in transforming their ideas into successful ones.
